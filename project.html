            Look, just because I don't be givin' no man a foot massage don't make it right for Marsellus to throw
            Antwone into a
            glass motherfuckin' house, fuckin' up the way the nigger talks. Motherfucker do that shit to me, he better
            paralyze
            my ass, 'cause I'll kill the motherfucker, know what I'm sayin'?

            The path of the righteous man is beset on all sides by the iniquities of the selfish and the tyranny of evil
            men.
            Blessed is he who, in the name of charity and good will, shepherds the weak through the valley of darkness,
            for he
            is truly his brother's keeper and the finder of lost children. And I will strike down upon thee with great
            vengeance
            and furious anger those who would attempt to poison and destroy My brothers. And you will know My name is
            the Lord
            when I lay My vengeance upon thee.

            Well, the way they make shows is, they make one show. That show's called a pilot. Then they show that show
            to the
            people who make shows, and on the strength of that one show they decide if they're going to make more shows.
            Some
            pilots get picked and become television programs. Some don't, become nothing. She starred in one of the ones
            that
            became nothing.
